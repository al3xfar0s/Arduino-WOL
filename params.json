Let's make arduino do it for me.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours this little program came up. In order to get it up and running properly follow the instructions:\r\n\r\n1) Edit the MAC address of the shield's Ethernet card( byte mac[] ) 2) Assign the proper gateway address, Arduino's IP address and subnet mask( byte ip[], byte gateway[], byte subnet[] ) 3) Assign the MAC address of the computer we want to wake ( byte remote_MAC_ADD[] ) 4) Assign Arduino a static IP on the router 5) Forward a specific port(e.g 56789) to our Arduino's IP port 23 6) Done!\r\n\r\nNow you either have to have a static ip at your home or use a dynamic dns service.\r\n\r\nSimply use telnet like this:\r\n\r\ne.g. telnet testing.no-ip.org:56789\r\n\r\nOnce is connected follow the instructions and arduino will wake your pc for you.",
